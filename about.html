                    Hi! I'm Lucy <i>(she/her)</i> and I'm a data science and history student currently studying at Smith College. I'm most interested in the history and epidemiology of infectious disease, but I'm also a big fan of attempting crosswords, TV as a medium, and 2+ cups of earl gray a day.

                    Me, age 6, always on that damn computer.

                    I'm making this site without a real target. I want something between and removed from the professional purgatory of LinkedIn and the personal black hole of Instagram. Somewhere to put my stuff that can be part-portfolio, part-scrapbook, and mostly fun.
                    All that's to say, I want to make things more than just consuming them.
                    Plus, teaching myself HTML feels a bit more productive than scrolling through Instagram posts that are just screenshots of Tumblr posts that are screenshots of Twitter posts.
                </p>

                    This is my first time making a website from scratch! Because I'm new, I mostly built it by looking at other people's things, and trying to reverse-engineer the HTML. Some super cool sites that I looked to included:
